# Project Management Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of project management features in the todolist frontend application, covering the components, relationship handling, CRUD operations, and data flow patterns.

## Overview

The project management feature allows users to:
- Create, read, update, and delete projects
- View project statistics and progress
- Associate todos with projects
- Navigate between project list and detail views

## Components Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. ProjectCard
**Location**: `src/components/ui/ProjectCard.tsx`

A card component that displays individual project information with:
- Project name and description
- Progress visualization with completion percentage
- Statistics chips (total, in-progress, pending todos)
- Action menu for edit/delete operations
- Click handler for navigation to project details

**Key Features**:
- Hover animations for better UX
- Responsive design with proper text truncation
- Material Design styling with icons
- Context menu for project actions

#### 2. ProjectCardWithStats
**Location**: `src/components/ui/ProjectCardWithStats.tsx`

A wrapper component that fetches project statistics using the `useProjectStats` hook and passes them to the ProjectCard. This separation was necessary to comply with React hooks rules.

**Purpose**:
- Encapsulates the statistics fetching logic
- Ensures proper hook usage within React component lifecycle
- Provides clean separation of concerns

#### 3. ProjectList
**Location**: `src/components/ui/ProjectList.tsx`

A container component that renders a grid of projects with:
- Loading states with skeleton placeholders
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Empty state messaging
- Responsive grid layout using CSS Grid

**Layout Strategy**:
- Mobile: Single column
- Tablet: Two columns
- Desktop: Three columns

#### 4. ProjectDetail
**Location**: `src/components/ui/ProjectDetail.tsx`

A detailed view component for individual projects featuring:
- Project information display (name, description, dates)
- Progress overview with completion rate
- Statistics cards showing todo counts by status
- Action menu for edit/delete operations
- Back navigation to project list

**Statistics Cards**:
- Total Tasks
- Completed Tasks
- In Progress Tasks
- Pending Tasks

#### 5. ProjectForm
**Location**: `src/components/forms/ProjectForm.tsx`

A modal form component for creating and editing projects with:
- Form validation using Zod schema
- React Hook Form integration
- Loading states during submission
- Error handling and user feedback

**Validation Rules**:
- Name: Required, 1-100 characters
- Description: Optional, max 500 characters

### Page Components

#### ProjectsPage
**Location**: `src/pages/projects/ProjectsPage.tsx`

The main page component that orchestrates the project management functionality:
- Project list view with search functionality
- Project detail view navigation
- Form modal management
- Delete confirmation dialogs
- Notification system for user feedback

**State Management**:
- Search term for filtering projects
- Selected project for detail view
- Form modal state (open/closed, editing mode)
- Delete confirmation dialog state
- Notification state for success/error messages

## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. Project CRUD Operations

#### Create Project Flow
```
User clicks "New Project" → ProjectForm opens → User fills form → 
Form validation → API call via useCreateProject → Success notification → 
Project list refresh → Form closes
```

#### Read Projects Flow
```
Page loads → useProjects hook triggers → API call to fetch projects → 
For each project: useProjectStats hook triggers → Statistics fetched → 
Projects rendered with stats
```

#### Update Project Flow
```
User clicks edit → ProjectForm opens with existing data → User modifies → 
Form validation → API call via useUpdateProject → Success notification → 
Cache update → Form closes
```

#### Delete Project Flow
```
User clicks delete → Confirmation dialog opens → User confirms → 
API call via useDeleteProject → Success notification → 
Cache invalidation → Project removed from list
```

### 2. Navigation Flow

#### List to Detail Navigation
```
User clicks project card → setSelectedProject(project) → 
ProjectDetail component renders → useProjectStats fetches detailed stats
```

#### Detail to List Navigation
```
User clicks back button → setSelectedProject(null) → 
ProjectList component renders
```

### 3. Search and Filtering

#### Search Flow
```
User types in search box → setSearchTerm(value) → 
useProjects hook re-triggers with search parameter → 
Filtered results displayed
```

## Relationship Handling

### Project-Todo Associations

#### In TodoForm
The existing TodoForm component already includes project selection:
- Autocomplete dropdown for project selection
- Optional project assignment
- Project relationship stored in todo.project_id

#### Data Consistency
- When a project is deleted, associated todos are handled by the backend
- Project statistics are calculated server-side
- Real-time updates through React Query cache invalidation

## API Integration

### Service Layer
**Location**: `src/services/projectService.ts`

The ProjectService class provides methods for:
- `getProjects(filters)` - Fetch paginated projects with search
- `getProjectById(id)` - Fetch single project details
- `createProject(data)` - Create new project
- `updateProject(data)` - Update existing project
- `deleteProject(id)` - Delete project
- `getProjectStats(id)` - Fetch project statistics

### React Query Integration

#### Custom Hooks
**Location**: `src/hooks/useProjects.ts`

- `useProjects(filters)` - Query hook for project list
- `useProject(id)` - Query hook for single project
- `useProjectStats(id)` - Query hook for project statistics
- `useCreateProject()` - Mutation hook for creating projects
- `useUpdateProject()` - Mutation hook for updating projects
- `useDeleteProject()` - Mutation hook for deleting projects

#### Cache Management
- Automatic cache invalidation on mutations
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Stale time configuration for performance
- Background refetching for data freshness

## Error Handling

### API Error Handling
- Standardized error responses from backend
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Loading states during operations

### Form Validation
- Client-side validation using Zod schemas
- Real-time validation feedback
- Server-side validation error display
- Graceful error recovery

### Network Error Handling
- Offline state detection
- Retry mechanisms
- User notification of network issues
- Graceful degradation

## Performance Optimizations

### Component Optimization
- React.memo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
- Proper key props for list rendering
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Efficient state updates

### Data Fetching Optimization
- React Query caching strategies
- Background refetching
- Stale-while-revalidate pattern
- Pagination for large datasets

### Bundle Optimization
- Code splitting at route level
- Tree shaking for unused code
- Optimized imports
- Lazy loading of non-critical features

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoint Strategy
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Adaptive component sizing
- Touch-friendly interactions

### Layout Adaptations
- **Mobile**: Single column layout, bottom navigation
- **Tablet**: Two-column grid, sidebar navigation
- **Desktop**: Three-column grid, full sidebar

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Grid Layout Issues**: Resolved by using CSS Grid instead of MUI Grid
2. **Hook Rules Violations**: Fixed by creating wrapper components
3. **Form Validation**: Implemented proper Zod schemas
4. **State Management**: Used React Query for server state

### Development Tips
- Use React Developer Tools for debugging
- Monitor network requests in browser DevTools
- Test responsive design with device emulation
- Validate accessibility with screen readers

## Conclusion

The project management implementation provides a comprehensive solution for organizing todos into projects. The architecture follows React best practices, implements proper error handling, and provides an excellent user experience across all device types.
