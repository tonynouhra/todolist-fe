# Task 1: Create Shared Navigation Configuration and Animation Constants

## Overview
Establish a centralized configuration system for navigation items and animation settings to ensure consistency across all navigation components.

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED**

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified
- ✅ `src/constants/navigation.ts` (new)
- ✅ `src/constants/animations.ts` (new) 
- ✅ Updated `src/constants/index.ts` to export new constants

### Key Accomplishments
- Created centralized navigation item definitions
- Established consistent animation configuration
- Implemented TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Made configuration reusable across all navigation components

### Technical Implementation
- Used proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Designed configuration structure for future extensibility
- Ensured configuration supports both sidebar and footer navigation needs

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ Navigation items are defined in a single, reusable configuration
- ✅ Animation settings are centralized and consistently applied
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces provide proper type checking
- ✅ All navigation components can import and use shared configuration

### Requirements Addressed
- 1.4: Consistent navigation behavior
- 2.2: Smooth animations
- 3.1: Responsive design considerations

## Notes
This foundational task established the shared configuration system that all subsequent navigation components depend on. The centralized approach ensures consistency and makes future maintenance much easier.
