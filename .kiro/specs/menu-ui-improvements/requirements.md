# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the user interface for menu opening/closing behavior to provide a more centralized and intuitive experience. The current implementation has issues with menu positioning and lacks a footer menu option when the sidebar is closed on desktop. This enhancement will improve the overall user experience by providing better visual feedback and more accessible navigation options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the menu opening/closing animation to be more centralized and smooth, so that the interface feels more polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the menu toggle button THEN the sidebar SHALL open/close with a smooth, centralized animation
2. WHEN the sidebar is opening THEN the main content SHALL transition smoothly to accommodate the sidebar width
3. WHEN the sidebar is closing THEN the main content SHALL expand smoothly to fill the available space
4. WHEN the menu button is clicked THEN the icon SHALL change appropriately (hamburger to close icon and vice versa) with smooth transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want to have a footer menu available when the sidebar is closed, so that I can still access navigation options without having to open the full sidebar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar is closed on desktop THEN a footer navigation bar SHALL be displayed at the bottom of the screen
2. WHEN the sidebar is open on desktop THEN the footer navigation bar SHALL be hidden
3. WHEN the user clicks on a footer navigation item THEN they SHALL be navigated to the corresponding page and the active page SHALL change
4. WHEN the current page matches a footer navigation item THEN that item SHALL be visually highlighted
5. IF the user is on mobile THEN the existing mobile navigation SHALL remain unchanged
6. WHEN the footer navigation is visible THEN an "Add Todo" button SHALL be prominently displayed as a separate section or floating action button

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the menu transitions to be consistent across different screen sizes, so that the experience feels cohesive regardless of device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transitioning between mobile and desktop views THEN the menu behavior SHALL adapt smoothly
2. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the appropriate navigation method (sidebar, mobile bottom nav, or footer nav) SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN animations are playing THEN they SHALL complete before allowing new interactions
4. WHEN the user has reduced motion preferences THEN animations SHALL be minimized or disabled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback when interacting with menu elements, so that I understand the current state and available actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over the menu toggle button THEN it SHALL show a hover state with appropriate visual feedback
2. WHEN the menu is in transition THEN the toggle button SHALL be temporarily disabled to prevent conflicts
3. WHEN navigation items are hovered THEN they SHALL show appropriate hover states
4. WHEN a navigation item is active THEN it SHALL be clearly highlighted in both sidebar and footer navigation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation menu to remain accessible while scrolling, so that I can navigate between pages without having to scroll back to the top.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls down the page THEN the sidebar SHALL remain fixed in position and visible
2. WHEN the footer navigation is displayed THEN it SHALL remain fixed at the bottom of the viewport during scrolling
3. WHEN scrolling occurs THEN the menu elements SHALL not disappear or become inaccessible
4. WHEN the page content is longer than the viewport THEN the navigation SHALL always be available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper spacing and alignment between the navigation menu and main content, so that the interface looks polished and content is properly aligned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar is open THEN there SHALL be minimal but adequate spacing between the sidebar and main content
2. WHEN the sidebar is closed THEN the main content SHALL be properly aligned to the left edge with appropriate margins
3. WHEN the footer navigation is visible THEN the main content SHALL have appropriate bottom padding to prevent overlap
4. WHEN transitioning between sidebar states THEN the content alignment SHALL adjust smoothly without jarring jumps
