# Task 9: Update Existing Components to Use Shared Navigation Configuration

## Overview
Refactor existing navigation components to use the centralized configuration system, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication.

## Status
‚è≥ **PENDING**

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/MobileNavigation.tsx` (if exists)
- Update related test files

### Key Tasks
- [ ] Refactor Sidebar component to use shared navigation constants
- [ ] Update MobileNavigation component to use shared navigation data
- [ ] Ensure consistent navigation behavior across all components
- [ ] Remove duplicate navigation item definitions

### Technical Implementation
- Ensure backward compatibility during refactoring
- Update imports and remove unused code
- Verify that all navigation items render correctly
- Test that routing still works properly after refactoring

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All navigation components use shared configuration
- [ ] No duplicate navigation item definitions exist
- [ ] Navigation behavior is consistent across components
- [ ] Code is cleaner and more maintainable

### Requirements Addressed
- 2.3: Active state highlighting
- 2.4: Hover effects
- 3.1: Cross-device compatibility

## Notes
This refactoring task will clean up the codebase by removing duplication and ensuring all navigation components use the centralized configuration established in Task 1.
