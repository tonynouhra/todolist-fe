## Status
ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`
- Update related test files

### Key Tasks
- [ ] Add `isTransitioning` state to prevent conflicting animations
- [ ] Implement `showDesktopFooter` logic based on sidebar state and screen size
- [ ] Add transition callbacks to coordinate sidebar and footer animations
- [ ] Update layout calculations to accommodate the new footer navigation

### Technical Implementation
- Use React hooks for state management (useState, useEffect)
- Implement proper cleanup for animation timers
- Handle edge cases like rapid user interactions
- Ensure state updates don't cause unnecessary re-renders

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Prevents multiple simultaneous transitions
- [ ] Correctly shows/hides footer based on sidebar state and screen size
- [ ] Coordinates animations between sidebar and footer
- [ ] Maintains proper layout spacing and positioning

### Requirements Addressed
- 1.1: Smooth sidebar transitions
- 2.1: Desktop footer navigation
- 2.2: Smooth animations
- 3.3: Coordinated component behavior

## Notes
This task is critical for ensuring smooth coordination between the sidebar and footer navigation components. The transition state management prevents conflicting animations and provides a better user experience.
