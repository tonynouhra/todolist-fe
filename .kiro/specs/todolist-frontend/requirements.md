# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a modern, beautiful, and user-friendly frontend for the todolist application. The frontend will be built using React with Material Design principles, integrating with the existing todolist backend API and using Clerk for authentication. The application should provide an intuitive interface for managing todos, projects, and leveraging AI-powered features.

## Requirements

1. WHEN a user accesses AI features THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to interact with AI services
2. WHEN a user requests AI suggestions THEN the system SHALL display relevant recommendations
3. WHEN AI processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. IF AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages
5. WHEN AI generates content THEN the system SHALL allow users to accept or modify suggestions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and work well on different devices, so that I can manage my todos from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout

3. WHEN a user accesses the application on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize the full screen space effectively
4. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adjust the layout accordingly
5. IF the device has touch capabilities THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly interactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates and notifications, so that I stay informed about changes to my todos and projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL update the UI in real-time without requiring page refresh
2. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL display success notifications
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with actionable guidance
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL indicate offline status
5. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL sync pending changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter and search my todos, so that I can quickly find specific tasks.
